Pinyin to X-SAMPA
=================

This program converts Pinyin to X-SAMPA phonetic symbols.

Released under LGPL 3.0 and above version.


Build
-----

For the Python version, use a Python 3 or newer interpreter to run it.

For the C++ version, use `gcc -std=c++11 -o pinyin2xsampa pinyin2xsampa.cpp` to build it.


Usage
-----

Input with Pinyin separated with a space between each word.

The output is in Vocaloid 3 style. However, several corrections are made, so the results are not exactly Vocaloid 3 phonetics.


Issues
------

Feel free to submit bug reports.
